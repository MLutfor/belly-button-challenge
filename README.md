# belly-button-challenge
 
In this assignment I build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The script for this programs is based on the codes provided by the in-class assignments from the U of T Data Analysis bootcamp. 

ChaGPT was also used in the assistance of debugging and refactoring the script.

The following challenge uses java script and html to create a website for analyzing the bacteria specimens living on the subject's belly buttons.
